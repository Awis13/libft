**LIBFT**

The libft project is a collection of commonly used algorithms and data structures implemented in C. This project is part of the 42 curriculum and is designed to help students learn low-level programming and algorithm design.

The libft.a library file is the core of this project. It contains a collection of functions that can be used in other C programs. The Makefile included in this project can be used to build the libft.a library file, as well as clean up any intermediate files that are generated during the build process.

To build the libft.a library, simply run make in the root directory of the project. This will compile the source files and create the libft.a library file. If you want to include the "bonus" functions in the library, you can run make bonus instead.

If you want to remove any intermediate files that are generated during the build process, you can run make clean. This will remove the object files that are generated when the source files are compiled. If you want to remove the libft.a library file as well, you can run make fclean instead.

If you want to start from scratch and rebuild the libft.a library, you can run make re. This is a shortcut for running make fclean followed by make.
